# New Project: LinkedIn Series Generator 🚀

Struggle with consistent LinkedIn content? I built something to fix that.

Here's my **LinkedIn Series Generator** – a simple, powerful tool designed to turn raw data (like stock analysis) into engaging, structured post series.

### What's Inside:
1.  **Multiple Post Types**: Whether it's "The Hook", "The Deep Dive", or "The TL;DR", pick the perfect structure for your message.
2.  **Instant Content Creation**: Just plug in your key points (e.g., stock ticker, main thesis) and generate a polished draft instantly.
3.  **Clean, distraction-free UI**: Focus on the content without clutter.

### How to Use It:
1.  **Select a Template** from the sidebar.
2.  **Fill in the specifics** (e.g., "AAPL", "Solid Q3 Earnings").
3.  **Hit Generate**: Get a structure you can post immediately.

### 💡 Pro Tip for Speed:
Take a screenshot of the generated output (or even the filled form) and drop it into ChatGPT or Claude. Ask it to:
> "Rewrite this into 3 different hooks based on the data provided."

This combines the structure of the tool with the creativity of AI for maximum impact.
